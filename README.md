Have you ever wanted a functional, concise, recursive way to traverse graphs in PHP? 
With traversal logic separate from actual node transformations?

...No?

Well, you get it anyway. Now eat your greens and enjoy them.

General idea (shamelessly) based on (I mean copied from)
["The Essence of Strategic Programming" by Ralf Lammel, Eelco Visser, Joost Visser](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277289331_The_Essence_of_Strategic_Programming)
Go read that for theory and examples.

Bonus: converts recursion to iteration.
